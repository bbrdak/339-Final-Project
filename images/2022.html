            <h1>THE CONCEPT</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            In 2022, the Boston Crusaders performed the show "Paradise Lost", based on the epic poem by John Milton of the same name. The Show follows the story of 
            Adam and Eve, as they are thrown out of heaven, find themselves in the Garden of Eden, face temptation from the Devil in the form of a snake, and 
            eventually cause their paradise, the Garden of Eden, to come crumbling down. The 2022 season was the most competitively successful season in the history
            of the corps, with a 2nd place finish at D.C.I. finals and a score of 97.325, a record high for the ensemble by nearly 3 points. 
        </p>

        <h2>MUSICAL SELECTIONS</h2>
        <p>"Paradise Lost" opens with a rendition of "A Child's Garden of Dreams" by David Maslanka, and features "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong as the 2nd 
            movement. The show continues with "Bad Hombres Y Mujeres" by Antonio SÃ¡nchez being used as a percussion feature. The 4th movement is a tango-esque rendition 
            of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" by Frankie Valli. The show concludes with Symphony No. 7, Mvt. 3 by David Maslanka and  
            Requiem in D Minor, Lacrimosa by Mozart.

        <h2>COMPETITIVE SUCCESS</h2>
        <p>The 2022 season was the most competitively successful season in the history of the corps. After a major staff turnover in 2017, the corps spent several years 
            hovering around 5th and 6th place. They entered 2022 with the aim of breaking into the top 3 at finals, and were able to do just that.
            Ultimately, the corps managed to earn a 2nd place finish at D.C.I. finals and a score of 97.325, a record high for the group by nearly 3 points.  </p>
